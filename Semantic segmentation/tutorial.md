Install pytorch (tested with pytorch 1.10), to install with anaconda do:
    conda install pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision==0.11.2 torchaudio==0.10.1 -c pytorch

Check [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/) for more information on how to do this, or on how to install pytorch on other solutions.


Set the parameters in the second cell of the notebook to match your dataset location and training conditions (batch size etc.)
